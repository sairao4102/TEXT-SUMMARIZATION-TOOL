# Text Summarization Tool

## Description
A web-based tool to summarize large text inputs using abstractive summarization and extract key points. This project was developed as part of my internship at **Codetech** Company (Task 1). It leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to make long texts more digestible and easily understandable.

## Technologies Used:
- **Flask**: Web framework to create the backend of the application.
- **Python**: Programming language for development.
- **Transformers**: Library for working with pre-trained models, used for abstractive summarization.
- **spaCy**: NLP library used for extracting key points.
- **HTML/CSS**: For frontend UI.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive frontend features.

## Features:
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Generate a concise summary of a given text.
- **Key Point Extraction**: Extract meaningful key points from the summary.
- **File Upload**: Upload a text file to extract the summary and key points.
- **Text Input**: Directly input text for summarization.

This project was developed as part of my internship at ** CODTECH IT Solutions** (Task 1).
